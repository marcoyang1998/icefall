        Initialize LmDataset object.   This keeps no state, it just gives you a totally random
        segment each time.  The training files are just viewed as sequences of bytes, from which
        we select chunks of a fixed size.  In training mode we just loop infinitely, and let
        the training code decide when to stop based on the count of tokens.  In test mode
        we loop so that we see each byte about once.
